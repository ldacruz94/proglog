# Proglog
Proglog is a distributed, append-only log service that is inspired by Kafka, built in Go.

It is primarily a learning project that I'm doing following the [Distributed Services with Go](https://a.co/d/hJD458O) book that explores how to build distributed systems and teaches concepts that are applicable to various programming languages.

# Motivation
I started this book and project because I wanted to deepen my understanding of distributed systems by building one from the ground up as opposed to relying on my current and past experiences of working on existing systems. I wanted hands-on experience with concepts for things like commit logs and gRPC service design, and this project lets me explore those ideas more in a language that I love. I certainly enjoy theory and concepts, but I feel that that knowledge obtained is more solidified when producing something tangible and extensible.

# Current Env
